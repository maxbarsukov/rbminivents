#rbminivents
##Description
This gem was made under the influence of the tiny JS library [minivents](https://github.com/allouis/minivents) by [allouis](https://github.com/allouis) that I liked. It seemed to me that it would be nice to transfer this to Ruby.

##API
The API is fully (hopefully) compatible with the original one.
So,

`on`: Listen to event

`off`: Stop listening to event

`emit`: Emit event
