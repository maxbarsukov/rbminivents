# rbminivents
This gem allows you to create and emit your events very easily and minimalistic.

## Description
This gem was made under the influence of the tiny JS library [minivents](https://github.com/allouis/minivents) by [allouis](https://github.com/allouis) that I liked. It seemed to me that it would be nice to transfer this to Ruby.

## Getting started

### Requirements

This gem requires Ruby 2.5+. It might work with older versions of Rails though.

### Installation

Add the gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'rbminivents'
```

and run:

```
bundle install
```

## API
This project is similar to the original one in many ways, but some features are not implemented
So,

`on`: Listen to event

`off`: Stop listening to event

`emit`: Emit event


## Examples
### Standard way
```ruby
require 'rbminivents'

sandbox = RbMinivents::Events.new

sandbox.on(:event) do
  # do stuff
end

sandbox.emit(:event)  # does stuff

sandbox.off(:event)

sandbox.emit(:event)  # does not do stuff
```

### Passing parameters
```ruby
require 'rbminivents'

sandbox = RbMinivents::Events.new

sandbox.on(:event) do |name|
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

sandbox.emit(:event, 'Max')  #=> Hello, Max!
# OR
# when there are > 1 arguments, pass them through the array
sandbox.emit(:event, ['Max'])  #=> Hello, Max!
```

```ruby
require 'rbminivents'

sandbox = RbMinivents::Events.new

sandbox.on(:event) do |hash, arr, num, bool|
  puts hash[:name]
  p arr
  puts "5 + #{num} = #{5 + num}"
  puts "It's true!" if bool
end

# max, [1, 2, 3], 5 + 7 = 12
sandbox.emit(:event,
             [ 
               {name: 'max'},
               [1, 2, 3],
               7,
               false
             ]
)
```
